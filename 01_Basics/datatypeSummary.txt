Primitive
(call by value)
7 types: String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt

=> Is JS dynamically typed or statically typed?
JavaScript is a *dynamic language and not static, which means that variables can hold values of different types during runtime. Unlike languages such as Typescript or Java, you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly

const id = Symbol('123')
const anotherId = Symbol('123')

console.log(id === anotherId); => false
As we pass the same value but it returns the unique value every time

const bigNumber = 3543576356426655n => BigInt datatype

Non-Primitive(Reference)

Array, Object, Functions

const animals = ["dog", "cat", "horse"]

let myObj = {
    name: john,
    age: 24, and many more 
}
inside obj => diff datatypes, array, functions, another object

function()
